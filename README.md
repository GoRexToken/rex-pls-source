REX on PulseChain

# Overview
This document provides a quick overview about the contracts and tokens and their functionality.

# Contracts
REX is a set of 5 smart contracts: 
1. REX (main staking token - as seen before)
2. DEX (exchange for REX STAKES - as seen before)
3. TREX (a support token (used in REX and DEX) - as seen before)
4. AIRDROP (free tokens/stakes for certain users - as seen before)
5. SAC / SACRIFICE (a possibility for new people to get the token) - NEW

# AUDIT
Only "REX" and "SAC" have to be audited.
The rest hasn't been changed really since the last Certik/SF/TechRate audit.

# SPECIAL AUDIT FOCUS
1) Is it possible to "hack" / "destroy" / "trick" the new SAC CONTRACT?
2) Does the sellableOf() function in "REX" work as described in the whitepaper?
